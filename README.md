### Project summary, description or abstract:
CONCCORRNET2023 is a labeled image dataset for training, testing, validation, and benchmarking of artificial intelligence based corrosion detection algortihms for concrete structures.

CONCCORRNET2023 contains 1,343 photographs of concrete structures with signs of corrosion problems. The photos are related with various concrete structures suh as columns, beams, slabs, and others.

The dataset includes diferent levels of corrosion damage and photographs with a variety of perturbations, including channel shift, horizontal flip, horizontal shift, random rotation, and random zoom.

CONCCORRNET2023 will comes in handy for the continued development of concrete corrosion detection tasks on algorithms based on deep learning, which is a field that is gaining momentum in Civil Engineering applications.
