## Project summary, description or abstract: üìö
<p align="justify"> CONCORNET2023 is a labeled image dataset for training, testing, validating, and benchmarking artificial intelligence-based corrosion detection algorithms for concrete structures. </p>

<p align="justify"> CONCORNET2023 contains 790 photographs of concrete structures with signs of corrosion problems. The photos relate to various concrete structures such as columns, beams, slabs, etc. </p>

<p align="justify"> The dataset includes different corrosion damage levels and photographs with various perturbations, including channel shift, horizontal flip, horizontal shift, random rotation, and random zoom.</p>

<p align="justify"> CONCORNET2023 will come in handy for the continued development of concrete corrosion detection tasks on algorithms based on deep learning, a field gaining momentum in Civil Engineering applications. </p>

## Files description: ‚úçÔ∏è
<p align="justify"> The repository contains a directory named Images, which contains the corrosion images on concrete structures in three sub-directories, train (632), test(79), and val (79). All the images are two-dimensional color images with .jpg extension. </p>

 <p align="justify"> Also, this repository stores a file named best.pt, which contains the computed weights using the YOLOv3 framework (ultralytics/yolov3) by the authors. The retrieved weights are parameters related to the employment of CONCORNET2023. </p>
